          "Zac was amazing with updating our website. He worked with such

          of the way. I would love to work with him again."

          "Zac is incredibly patient and thorough in his consulting. He was
          attentive and thoughtful to each question I posed and communicated the
          more technical discussions of our website in a way that was accessible
          for me and my rudimentary web development knowledge."

          "AIMS connected with Zac after a workshop designed for nonprofit use
          of Google Ads. We hired him to help us understand our own Google
          Analytics Dashboard, and his straightforward, upbeat approach made it
          all so accessible. From that moment on, he has been our lead
          strategist on Web site streamlining and engagement. Zac has the rare
          ability to help small organizations like ours to both maximize our
          resources, yet think innovatively about connecting with our
          audience—all within our budget. He genuinely cares about helping
          organizations find the best solution."

          "I’ve worked with Zac for several years and on many different
          projects. He has a great personality and working with him is
          stress-free. I describe him as delivering amazing work without ANY
          drama. He’s a true partner. I recommend Zac as often as I can to
          others looking to develop or redevelop their website."
