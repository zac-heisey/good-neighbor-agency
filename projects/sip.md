      Secure Information Project (SIP) is a start-up nonprofit in Philadelphia, PA whose mission is to provide document and information security to vulnerable families. Unfortunately, low-income families and new immigrants who are refugees and asylum-seekers often live in temporary and insecure homes. This leaves many of them - along with their valuables and critical documents - vulnerable to crime, fires and floods, pests like rodents and insects, and untrustworthy landlords.

      ## The Brief

      SIP came to Good Neighbor with some initial branding and visual identity assets (e.g. logo, colors, and typography), but needed to establish an online presence in order to spread the word about their efforts.

      ## The Concept

      Good Neighbor worked closely with SIP to develop a cohesive approach to building their online presence. After crafting a logical information architecture, along with a navigational flowchart and sitemap, we moved into developing wireframes that took advantage of a component-based approach to creating pages for the web.

      To enabled the team at SIP to take over management of their site and make content edits and updates on their own, we also laid out a roadmap and requirements to pair our custom design with a user-friendly CMS (content management system).

      ## The Outcome

       We delivered a 100% custom website to SIP that featured a collection of component-driven pages that the SIP team could mix and match to create customized pages moving forward. The website is fully responsive and extremely performant due to the fact that we did not use any bulky frameworks and limited 3rd part resources.
