      Secure Information Project (SIP) is a start-up nonprofit in Philadelphia,
      PA whose mission is to provide document and information security to
      vulnerable families. Unfortunately, low-income families and new immigrants
      who are refugees and asylum-seekers often live in temporary and insecure
      homes. This leaves many of them - along with their valuables and critical
      documents - vulnerable to crime, fires and floods, pests like rodents and
      insects, and untrustworthy landlords.


      ## The Brief


      SIP came to Good Neighbor with some initial branding and visual identity assets (e.g. logo, colors, and typography), but needed to establish an online presence in order to spread the word about their efforts. They had a simple one-page website, but it was failing to clearly communicate SIP's mission and vision. It also wasn't easy to update or fully responsive.


      Good Neighbor was tasked with creating a brand new website for SIP from the ground up.


      ## The Concept


      Good Neighbor worked closely with SIP to develop a cohesive approach to building their online presence, starting with a custom-designed website that would be both flexible and future-proof. We selected imagery that was powerful and emotional, paired with a bold yellow frame to focus attention and highlight the human aspect of SIP's mission.

      ## The Outcome


      After crafting a logical information architecture, along with a navigational flowchart and sitemap, we moved into developing wireframes that took advantage of a component-based approach to creating pages for the web. To enabled the team at SIP to take over management of their site and make content edits and updates on their own, we also laid out a roadmap and requirements to pair our custom design with a user-friendly CMS (content management system).

      We delivered a fully custom website to SIP that featured a component-driven approach to content creation. This allowed editors to mix and match different components to easily create customized pages. The website is fully responsive and extremely performant due to the fact that we strictly limited our use of frameworks and 3rd party resources.
