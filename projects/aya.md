      Through a unique combination of academic mentorship and urban squash, [Access Youth Academy (AYA)](https://accessyouthacademy.org/) works to transform the lives of underserved youth in San Diego, California. Students accepted into AYA's program begin their journey in 7th grade and receive intellectual, physical, and social guidance and enrichment over the next 12 years.

      Through scholarship and sportsmanship, AYA aims to shape community leaders, fuel academic achievement, and help Access students navigate the process from high school, to college, and into a successful career.

      ## The Brief

      Since being founded in 2006, AYA has maintained a simple, utilitarian aesthetic that has served the organization well for many years. However, with the breaking of ground on a $12 million, state-of-the art Academic Squash Center in southeast San Diego, AYA was looking to reconceptualize their visual identity to better reflect the organization's mission, vision, and impact.

      ## The Concept

      Good Neighbor will begin by closely examining AYA's current visual identity and branding strategy in order gather insights and inspiration. After gathering data, multiple versions of visual identity assets will be created, each reflecting AYA's dedication to scholarship, sportsmanship, and transforming the lives of underserved youth.

      Along with a fresh visual identity, Good Neighbor will also create concepts for print collateral to help AYA envision how their new brand assets might be reflected in the real world.

      ## The Outcome

      Along with updated typography and a new color palette, four logo concepts were developed for AYA. Both the round and the crest logo concepts took inspiration from academic and athletic academies, particularly those in Europe. The goal with each of these concepts is to communicate AYA's commitment to their student's academic and athletic excellence, while giving an air of ceremony and pride.

      Good Neighbor then developed print collateral that incorporates AYA's new visual identity concepts. Specifically, we created two versions of letterhead, business card mockups, and a new take on AYA's annual report.
