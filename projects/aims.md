      Since 1967, AIMS (Association of Independent Maryland and DC Schools) has been providing accreditation services and professional development opportunities to their 120 member schools. From workshops to conferences, credentialing to career growth, AIMS is the go-to resource for faculty and staff of independent schools through Maryland and Washington DC.

      ## The Brief

      The team at AIMS was interested in offering new workshops and events to their members that would focus on building digital and technical skills. The primary audience for these new workshops would be staff members working in their school's marketing and/or communications departments. These departments are typically tasked with managing and improving their school's digital presence, maintaining the school website, social media accounts, analytics and data tracking, email marketing efforts, online advertising strategy, and more.

      ## The Concept

      AIMS and Good Neighbor Agency collaborated to create a series of in-person and virtual workshops intended to provide foundational knowledge in specialized areas for marketing and communications staff. These workshops helped attendees become more comfortable with tools, platforms, and concepts that they interact with everyday (e.g. various Google products, search engine optimization (SEO) and social media, web design and development, software selection and integration, etc.).

      ## The Outcome

      Since 2017, Good Neighbor Agency has facilitated multiple workshops and training sessions for AIMS members schools focused on building practical digital skills, including:

      - Google Analytics 101 & 201

      - Google AdWords for Beginners

      - Advanced Google AdWords

      - Introduction to SEO
      
      - Choose Your Own Digital Adventure
